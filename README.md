# css-integration-challenge

PROJECT : Challenge Integration



This project is part of my Becode training in Web Development. It consists of 3 different mockups that I had to recreate as precisely as possible using HTML/CSS, within a single HTML file.



Motivation 



The motivation behind this exercise is to use CSS and HTML to closely approximate 3 mockups, and in doing so, learn how to resolve issues and to overcome obstacles from Git branching to CSS classes and layouts. While strictly « front-end », this exercise is thus quite comprehensive and aims at evaluating what we learned during our first month at Becode.



Build Status



Alpha-build (far from complete) : 

All 3 mockups have been sketched, the first one being the most stable/advanced
Numerous issues regarding the responsiveness between desktop and mobile
Need to find better fonts, especially for Interface 2 and 3
I did not have time to do the chart with CSS for Interface 2, so I simply used a screenshot of the chart. 


Code Style



Again, pretty messy, so I guess « noob style ». More seriously, I’m following the exercise guidelines, only using basic CSS and HTML; so no bootstrap, no SASS, no JS.
